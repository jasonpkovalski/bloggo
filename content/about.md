I currently live in **Boston** with my girlfriend. ♥️

I'm first-generation American-born. Mom and Dad are immigrants from **Korea** and **Poland**, respectively. I'm also a first-generation college graduate. **Boston College** CSOM 2016.

My first *real* job after college was at **Liberty Mutual Insurance** as a software developer. I left after 2.5 years to join **Salesforce** as a full-stack software engineer. I've worked at [other](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonkovalski) places too.

I gave up competitive **Hearthstone**, a children's card game, for **Super Smash Bros.**, a children's fighting game. I mostly [tweet](https://twitter.com/grim_ssbu) about Smash, but I also talk about technology and programming.


I was a 74kg **Powerlifter** for a few years, but I've also tried Strongman and CrossFit. Now I just train for general fitness. I occasionally [post](https://www.instagram.com/jk1.618/) lifting videos when I'm feeling strong and/or big.
