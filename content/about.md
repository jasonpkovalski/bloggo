I love technology, from shiny gadgets that I definitely don't need to what I do at work everyday. My expertise is primarily in automation, infrastructure, and cloud computing. Some of the things I regularly use include: Python, Go, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and AWS. More details on my professional experience can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonkovalski). I work on personal [projects](https://github.com/jasonpkovalski) too.

I also enjoy investing, competitive Smash Bros., and strength training. I mostly [tweet](https://twitter.com/grim_ssbu) about Smash, and I occasionally [post](https://www.instagram.com/jk1.618/) lifting videos when I'm feeling strong and/or big.
