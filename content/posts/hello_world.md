After years of talking about starting a blog, here it finally is. This is a personal blog, and I want to use it to share my knowledge and excitement with as many people as possible.

I spend a lot of time and effort on my interests, so I'm happy to have this platform to talk about them. Initially, I would like to focus my content on **technology** and **finance**, but posts about **fitness** and **eSports** are fair game too. Some topics you can expect are gadget reviews, software engineering tutorials, and investment tips.

### Goals for Blog

- Create valuable content
- Document my journey
- Earn passive income

Keep in mind that I haven't written anything besides code since college, so please bear with my mediocre writing for the time being. I promise it will improve!
